<h1 style="font-size: 50px;">Jabberwocky</h1>
<h3>by Lewis Carroll</h3>
<p><i><span class="drop-cap">’T</span>was brillig, and the slithy toves<br/>
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:<br/>
All mimsy were the borogoves,<br/>
And the mome raths outgrabe.<br/>
<br/>
“Beware the Jabberwock, my son!<br/>
The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!<br/>
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun<br/>
The frumious Bandersnatch!”<br/>
<br/>
He took his vorpal sword in hand;<br/>
Long time the manxome foe he sought—<br/>
So rested he by the Tumtum tree<br/>
And stood awhile in thought.<br/>
<br/>
And, as in uffish thought he stood,<br/>
The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,<br/>
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,<br/>
And burbled as it came!<br/>
<br/>
One, two! One, two! And through and through<br/>
The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!<br/>
He left it dead, and with its head<br/>
He went galumphing back.<br/>
<br/>
“And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?<br/>
Come to my arms, my beamish boy!<br/>
O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!”<br/>
He chortled in his joy.<br/>
<br/>
’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br/>
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:<br/>
All mimsy were the borogoves,<br/>
And the mome raths outgrabe.<br/></i></p>
